    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional Nicaraguan nacatamales make an excellent Sunday breakfast that
      will surprise most people due to their large size – almost 10 ounces. A
      proper nacatamal is large, always wrapped in banana leaves, and has an
      ultra-fine corn dough. It's usually filled with pork or chicken in adobo
      sauce, a bit of rice, a slice of potato and tomato, a stem of mint,
      raisins, prunes, olives, peanuts, chili peppers and pieces of pork jowl.
      According to custom, this dish is accompanied by bread and café con leche,
      but the type of drink served can vary according to the occasion. Some
      cooks add puréed potato to the dough, to give it body and volume. In
      recent years, vegetarian nacatamales and other interesting versions have
      become available as well. What's certain is that Nicaraguans love their
      nacatamales, and don't only enjoy them at home, but at fiestas and
      celebrations also. For these occasions it's normal that mini nacatalmales
      are served; made with the same fillings, just smaller. This cocktail-sized
      appetizer can be specially pre-ordered in advance or made at home. If
      hand-made, the family will usually help out to make the work go faster,
      since preparation for these tamales starts at least 24 hours in advance.
      Hopefully this recipe will motivate you to try preparing these
      nacatamales–it's an intense job, but can be shared by the whole family. So
      why not put your hands to work and enjoy the preparation!

    <h3>To assemble</h3>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First prepare the meat for the filling. The rib meat and pork jowl
        should be cooked in a covered pot over low heat with the tomatoes,
        onion, bell pepper, garlic, dissolved achiote, bitter orange juice, salt
        and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 or one full cup of water if necessary, and when the meat is
        tender, adjust the seasoning as desired. Remove from heat and let cool;
        the meat should be juicy and well seasoned.
      </li>
      <li>
        To prepare the dough, place the corn flour in a bowl. Add the lukewarm
        water, bitter orange juice and knead constantly. Slowly incorporate the
        melted pork drippings and salt. The dough should be very smooth and
        similar in texture to play-dough. If the result is too dry, add a bit of
        water. Remember that as the dough rests, it will become more firm. When
        this happens, place in a pot over medium-heat and stir with a wooden
        spoon for around 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have the banana leaves ready for assembling the nacatamales. Take two
        leaves and place in the form of a cross. Place a 3/4-cup portion of
        dough in the center, where the leaves overlap, and slightly flatten with
        your hand. Over the dough, add a piece of pork meat and two cubes of
        pork jowl. Cover with one tablespoon of sauce left from cooking the
        pork.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the side of the dough, place one tablespoon of soaked rice, with one
        slice of potato, tomato, onion and a stem of mint.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the other side of the dough, add an olive, one prune, two raisins,
        one peanut, two capers and two habanero peppers (one red and one green.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Close the tamale as if it was an empanada, securing the contents well
        with the banana leaves, so that none of the filling falls out. Tie the
        nacatamales with twine to keep closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook, cover the base of a large pot with a rack and place the
        leftover banana leaf scraps on top. Then add the prepared nacatamales
        followed by more banana leaves. Add enough boiling water to fill half of
        the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot with a lid and cook over medium heat to steam the tamales
        for three to four hours. Remember that you’ll have to add more hot water
        over time, as it boils away.
      </li>
      <li>When finished, serve hot accompanied with pita bread.</li>
